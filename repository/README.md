Resource Repository
===========================================================

This module is currently handling all SPARQL-Query messages and all INFORM messages to store the given Graph in the tripletstore. 
Most of this functionality should be moved to other modules with more precise tasks, see e.g. the reservation module (https://github.com/FITeagle/core/tree/master/reservation).

Installation
